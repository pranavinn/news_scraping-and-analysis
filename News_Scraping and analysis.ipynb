            "Reuters Surgeons like Elias Jaradeh have been working around the clock to treat thousands of wounded people\n",
            "\n",
            "A Lebanese surgeon has described how the sheer volume of severe wounds from two days of exploding device attacks forced him to act \"robotic\" just to be able to keep working. Surgeon Elias Jaradeh said he treated women and children but most of the patients he saw were young men. The surgeon said a large proportion were “severely injured” and many had lost the sight in both eyes. The dead and injured in Lebanon include fighters from Hezbollah – the Iranian backed armed group which has been trading cross-border fire with Israel for months and is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US. But members of their families have also been killed or wounded, along with innocent bystanders. Elias Jaradeh described the wounded he treated as looking \"mostly civilian\".\n",
            "\n",
            "The bomb attacks – which killed 37 people including two children – have been widely blamed on Israel, which has not claimed responsibility. Warning: This report contains graphic details Dr Jaradeh, who is also an MP for the Change parliamentary bloc, was working at a specialist eye and ear hospital where some of the most severely wounded people were sent. He said it had taken a toll on the medical teams, himself included. \"And, yes, it's very hard,\" the surgeon said. \"You have to dissociate yourself. More or less, you are robotic. This is the way you have to behave, but inside, you are deeply injured. You are seeing the nation injured.\" Surgeons like Dr Jaradeh worked for almost 24 hours continuously on the wounded, many of whom have lost their eyesight or the use of their hands, the country's health minister told the BBC. Eye specialist Prof Elias Warrak told BBC Arabic that in one night he extracted more damaged eyes than he had previously in his entire career. \"It was very hard,\" he said. \"Most of the patients were young men in their twenties and in some cases I had to remove both eyes. In my whole life I had not seen scenes similar to what I saw yesterday.\" Health Minister Firass Abiad told the BBC the victims' injuries would prove life-changing. “This is something that unfortunately will require a lot of rehabilitation,” he said. About 3,200 people were injured, most of them in Tuesday's attack which saw thousands of pagers detonated. Wednesday's attack, which detonated two-way radio devices, wounded about 450 people but was responsible for 25 deaths, twice as many as in Tuesday's blasts.\n",

            "Watch: Moment devices explode across Lebanon\n",
            "\n",
            "Abiad told the BBC the attacks constituted a war crime. “The whole world could see that these attacks occurred in markets,” he said. “These were not people who were at the battleground fighting. They were in civilian areas with their families.” Witnesses described seeing people with severe wounds to their faces and hands after the attacks. Journalist Sally Abou al-Joud says she saw patients \"covered in blood\" at hospitals, where ambulances were arriving \"one after the other within the minute\". Most injuries she saw were \"in the faces and the eyes\". \"We’re talking about hands injured, severely injured fingers torn, I’ve heard some doctors say we need to perform amputation surgeries to remove hands... they need to perform surgeries for eyes to remove them,\" she said. One woman told BBC Arabic on Thursday that what they had seen was a \"massacre in every sense of the world\". \"Young men were walking in the street with injuries to their hands, waist and eyes... they were unable to see anything,\" she said. In the aftermath of Tuesday's blasts, writer and politician Tracy Chamoun said she saw one man with his eye blown out and another \"had half of his face ripped off\". She had been driving in southern Beirut - a Hezbollah stronghold - at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many Lebanese in Beirut say the device attacks have reignited their trauma from the Beirut port explosion four years ago. At least 200 people were killed and 5,000 injured when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at a warehouse in the port blew up, sending a mushroom cloud into the air and a supersonic blastwave tearing through the city. \"We remembered such painful scenes... it is something truly terrifying,\" one woman told BBC Arabic. \"A state of confusion, discomfort and anxiety is dominating all Lebanon... what happened to us four years ago is being repeated now.” In the aftermath of the exploding pagers and radio devices the Lebanese army has been destroying suspicious devices with controlled detonations, while walkie-talkies and pagers have now been banned onboard all flights operating at Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport - the only operational commercial airport in Lebanon. More than 90 of those injured are now in Iran receiving further treatment, according to Tehran's embassy in Lebanon. That includes Iran's ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, whose condition has been described as \"very good\" by the embassy in its statement. Officials didn't elaborate on how serious the injuries suffered by the other transferees were. Abiad said the \"weaponisation of technology” was something very serious, he said, not only for Lebanon but also for the rest of the world, and for other conflicts. “Now we have to think twice before using technology,” he said.\n",

            "BBC\n",
            "\n",
            "The prime minister has insisted he is “completely in control” after the BBC revealed a row within government over staff pay. It has emerged Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, received a pay rise which means she is now on a higher salary than him. The story, briefed to the BBC by a number of sources, painted a picture of fractious relationships at the heart of government, less than three months after Labour's general election victory. Challenged by BBC South East political editor Charlotte Wright on a spate of off-the-record briefings about Ms Gray, the PM said: “I'm focused and every day the message from me to the team is exactly the same, which is we have to deliver.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "He added: \"We were elected on a big mandate to deliver change. I am determined that we are going to do that.\" In interviews with other BBC regional political editors, Sir Keir defended his decision to accept corporate hospitality from Arsenal football club, saying he could no longer use his season ticket as prime minister. The Premier League club has made two seats available to the prime minister in the corporate area of Emirates Stadium. He said he had been advised it would cost the taxpayer more in security costs to use his normal seat. He would \"rather be in the stands\", but accepting a corporate ticket was a \"perfectly sensible arrangement\", he added.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Permanent frustration'\n",
            "\n",
            "On Wednesday, the BBC revealed it had been told that Ms Gray asked for and was given a salary of £170,000 after July's election - about £3,000 more than the PM and more than her Conservative predecessor, Rishi Sunak's chief of staff. One source told the BBC: \"It was suggested that she might want to go for a few thousand pounds less than the prime minister to avoid this very story. She declined.\" But others in government have spoken passionately in Ms Gray’s defence, and believe there is a misplaced, grossly unfair and deeply personal campaign against her. Her salary has proved particularly controversial partly because other advisers believe they are being underpaid. Most were expecting pay rises when they entered government, only to discover they would be paid less. Many of the disappointed advisers blame Ms Gray specifically - although others insist pay is a matter for civil servants. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds dismissed suggestions the prime minister had personally intervened to increase Ms Gray's salary, saying ministers had \"no input\" in what their advisers were paid. \"There’s a process that exists, it’s a civil service process, it hasn’t changed. It’s wrong to say there’s any kind of political input in there or people set their own pay bands. \"I don’t even get to set the pay for my own advisers... I think there are and always have been officials who are paid more than politicians in our system and that hasn’t changed,\" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Reynolds acknowledged that leaks about issues in government such as Ms Gray’s pay were “annoying” and \"a permanent frustration\".\n",

            "Five women say they were raped by former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed when they worked at the luxury London department store. The BBC has heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees who say the billionaire, who died last year aged 94, sexually assaulted or raped them. The documentary and podcast - Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods - gathered evidence that, during Fayed’s ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene, but helped cover up abuse allegations. Harrods’ current owners said they were “utterly appalled” by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The spider’s web of corruption and abuse in this company was unbelievable and very dark,” says barrister Bruce Drummond, from a legal team representing a number of the women. Since this article was first published, more former Harrods employees have contacted the BBC saying Mohammed Al Fayed assaulted them. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. The incidents took place in London, Paris, St Tropez and Abu Dhabi. “I made it obvious that I didn't want that to happen. I did not give consent. I just wanted it to be over,” says one of the women, who says Fayed raped her at his Park Lane apartment. Another woman says she was a teenager when he raped her at the Mayfair address. “Mohamed Al Fayed was a monster, a sexual predator with no moral compass whatsoever,” she says, adding that all the staff at Harrods were his “playthings”. “We were all so scared. He actively cultivated fear. If he said ‘jump’ employees would ask ‘how high’.” Fayed faced sexual assault claims while he was alive, but these allegations are of unprecedented scale and seriousness. The BBC believes many more women may have been assaulted.\n",

            "Fayed's entrepreneurial career began on the streets of Alexandria, Egypt, where he hawked fizzy drinks to passers-by. But it was his marriage to the sister of a millionaire Saudi arms dealer that helped him forge new connections and build a business empire. He moved to the UK in 1974 and was already a well-known public figure when he took over Harrods in 1985. In the 1990s and 2000s, he would regularly appear as a guest on prime-time TV chat and entertainment shows. Meanwhile, Fayed - whose son Dodi was killed in a car crash alongside Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 - has become known to a new generation through the two most recent Netflix series of The Crown.\n",

            "But the women we have spoken to say his portrayal as pleasant and gregarious was far from the truth. “He was vile,” says one of the women, Sophia, who worked as his personal assistant from 1988 to 1991. She says he tried to rape her more than once. “That makes me angry, people shouldn't remember him like that. It's not how he was.” Some of the women waived, or partially waived, their right to anonymity to be filmed - and the BBC agreed not to use surnames. Others chose to remain anonymous. Put together, their testimonies reveal a pattern of predatory behaviour and sexual abuse by Fayed. The Harrods owner would regularly tour the department store's vast sales floors and identify young female assistants he found attractive, who would then be promoted to work in his offices upstairs - former staff, male and female, told us. The assaults would be carried out in Harrods’ offices, in Fayed's London apartment, or on foreign trips - often in Paris at the Ritz hotel, which he also owned, or his nearby Villa Windsor property. At Harrods, other former staff members told us it was clear what was happening. “We all watched each other walk through that door thinking, ‘you poor girl, it's you today’ and feeling utterly powerless to stop it,” Alice, not her real name, says.\n",

            "Rachel, not her real name, worked as a personal assistant in Harrods in the 1990s. One night after work, she says she was called to his luxury apartment, in a large block on Park Lane overlooking London's Hyde Park. The building was protected by security staff and had an on-site office staffed by Harrods employees. Rachel says Fayed asked her to sit on his bed and then put his hand on her leg, making it clear what he wanted. “I remember feeling his body on me, the weight of him. Just hearing him make these noises. And… just going somewhere else in my head. “He raped me.” The BBC has spoken to 13 women who say Fayed sexually assaulted them at 60 Park Lane. Four of them, including Rachel, say they were raped. Sophia, who says she was sexually assaulted, described the whole situation as an inescapable nightmare. “I couldn't leave. I didn’t have a [family] home to go back to, I had to pay rent,” she says. “I knew I had to go through this and I didn’t want to. It was horrible and my head was scrambled.”\n",

She says it culminated in her being raped at Villa Windsor in Paris's Bois de Boulogne - a former home, post-abdication, of King Edward VIII and his wife Wallis Simpson. Gemma says she woke up startled in her bedroom. Fayed was next to her bed wearing just a silk dressing gown. He then tried to get into bed with her. “I told him, ‘no, I don't want you to’. And he proceeded to just keep trying to get in the bed, at which point he was kind of on top of me and [I] really couldn't move anywhere. “I was kind of face down on the bed and he just pressed himself on me.” She says after Fayed raped her she cried, while he got up and told her aggressively to wash herself with Dettol. “Obviously he wanted me to erase any trace of him being anywhere near me,” she explains. Eight other women have also told us they were sexually assaulted by Fayed at his properties in Paris. Five women described the assaults as an attempted rape.\n",

It “wasn't even a secret”, recalls Mr Leeming, who says he did not know about more serious allegations of assault or rape. \"And I think if I knew, everybody knew. Anyone who says they didn't are lying, I'm sorry\". Mr Leeming's testimony is backed up by former members of Fayed's security team. “We were aware that he had this very strong interest in young girls,” says Eamon Coyle, who joined Harrods in 1979 as a store detective, then became deputy director of security from 1989-95. Meanwhile Steve, who does not want us to use his surname, worked for the billionaire between 1994-95. He told us that security staff “did know that certain things were happening to certain female employees at Harrods and Park Lane”. Many of the women told us that when they began working directly for Fayed they underwent medicals - including invasive sexual health tests carried out by doctors. This was presented as a perk, the women told us, but many did not see their own results - even though they were sent to Fayed. “There is no benefit to anybody knowing what my sexual health is, unless you're planning to sleep with somebody, which I find quite chilling now,” says Katherine, who was an executive assistant in 2005.\n",

Sarah, not her real name, explained: “There was most definitely a culture of fear across the whole store - from the lowliest of the low, to the most senior person.” Others told us they believed the phones in Harrods had been tapped - and that women had been scared of talking to each other about Fayed’s abuse, fearing they were being filmed by hidden cameras. The ex-deputy director of security, Eamon Coyle, confirmed this - explaining how part of his job was to listen to tapes of recorded calls. Cameras that could record had also been installed throughout the store, he said, including in the executive suites. “He [Fayed] bugged everybody that he wanted to bug.” Harrods told the BBC in a statement these had been the actions of an individual “intent on abusing his power” which it condemned in the strongest terms. It said: “The Harrods of today is a very different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed between 1985 and 2010, it is one that seeks to put the welfare of our employees at the heart of everything we do.”\n",

            "There were a number of attempts to expose Fayed before his death - notably by Vanity Fair in 1995 - with an article alleging racism, staff surveillance and sexual misconduct. This sparked a libel lawsuit. Mohamed Al Fayed later agreed to drop the case as long as all the further evidence the magazine had gathered of his sexual misconduct in preparation for a trial was locked away. Fayed’s settlement was negotiated by a senior Harrods executive. In 1997, ITV’s The Big Story reported further serious allegations including sexual harassment and groping - which is classed as sexual assault. One of the women in the BBC investigation, Ellie, not her real name, was 15 in 2008 when she reported an assault to the police - an allegation that made headlines - but did not result in any charge. In 2017, Channel 4’s Dispatches broadcast allegations of groping, assault and harassment, with one woman waiving her right to anonymity for the first time. It gave some women the courage to come forward - and was followed by a 2018 investigation on Channel 4 News. But it is only now, with Mohamed Al Fayed having died last year, that many of the women have felt able to speak publicly about rape and attempted rape.\n",

            "The BBC documentary reveals that, as part of Gemma's settlement in 2009, she had to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), a legally-binding contract which ensures information remains confidential. She says after she was raped, she contacted a lawyer who told Harrods she was leaving her job on the grounds of sexual harassment. Gemma says she did not feel able, at that time, to disclose the full extent and seriousness of Fayed's assaults. Harrods agreed she could leave and it would pay a sum of money in exchange for her shredding all evidence and signing an NDA. Gemma says a member of Harrods’ HR team was present as the shredding took place. The BBC has heard that women were threatened and intimidated by Harrods' then-director of security, John Macnamara, to stop them speaking out. Fourteen of the women we spoke to recently brought civil claims against Harrods for damages. The shop's current owners, who are not asking women to sign NDAs, started settling these in July 2023. It took Sophia and Harrods five years to reach an agreement. In her case, the store expressed regret but did not admit liability. Many more women are now considering legal action against Harrods.\n",

            "A charity chief executive has apologised \"unreservedly\" to rape survivors affected by failings at support centre in Edinburgh. Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) came under fire when a review found it had failed to provide women-only spaces for 16 months, and that its CEO - trans woman Mridul Wadhwa - had not acted professionally or understood the limits of her authority. Sandy Brindley, of Rape Crisis Scotland, said she found out the centre was not following national standards last October and paused referrals 11 months later when the review said safeguarding was a problem. She told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme there was no reason why transgender people could not work in rape support centres, but that services must also provide women-only spaces.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Brindley stressed that Rape Crisis Scotland, which is the national charity that sets service standards for member centres, had no involvement in hiring Ms Wadhwa - who stood down from her role after the review was published last week. However she said there had been \"no reason\" not to agree with the appointment at the time as Ms Wadhwa had significant experience of working in the sector. The role Ms Wadhwa had is reserved for women only – which under recent guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission includes trans women who have a gender recognition certificate. Ms Wadhwa took over the ERCC in 2021 - before this guidance was updated. Acknowledging that Ms Wadhwa's appointment had been controversial, Ms Brindley said: \"I was not involved in that appointment or that decision. But what I would say is that most rape crisis centres in Scotland provide support to men, women, trans people and non-binary people. \"There is no inherent reason within that, that you could not have a trans person working within a rape crisis centre. \"I think what is crucial however, is that if you do have a rape crisis service, that is supporting all survivors is that there's dedicated women-only spaces within that.\" Ms Brindley added she \"absolutely recognised\" that women-only spaces were a priority for many women using rape support services.\n",

She has been working in the the violence against women and equality sectors in Scotland since 2005. She has previously tried to stand for election for the SNP but was not selected as a candidate and later joined the Scottish Greens. In a 2020 interview with The Ferret news service, she said that coverage of claims she was “legally male” had unleashed “a host of hate” and that the focus on having a gender recognition certificate was racist as well as transphobic because it failed to take in Indian cultural norms. The following year she was interviewed on the Guilty Feminist podcast, and was asked about rape survivors who might be uncomfortable with the presence of trans women in spaces such as rape crisis centres. In her response, she said that “sexual violence can happen to bigoted people too” and that if rape victims hold “unacceptable beliefs that are discriminatory in nature we will begin to work with you on your journey of recovery from trauma”.\n",

            "'Damage to some survivors'\n",
            "\n",
            "Controversy arose around the Edinburgh centre when an employment tribunal found in May of this year that a counsellor - Roz Adams - had been unfairly constructively dismissed over her belief that people who used the service should be able to know the sex of the staff that would be dealing with their case. Ms Wadhwa was highlighted in the tribunal outcome as she appeared to believe that Ms Adams was transphobic. Rape Crisis Scotland then commissioned legal consultant Vicky Ling to review the Edinburgh service. Ms Ling found that the centre had failed to protect women-only spaces for 16 months and that Ms Wadhwa \"did not understand the limits on her role’s authority, when to refer decisions to trustees and failed to set professional standards of behaviour\". The report also said there was \"evidence that the actions of some ERCC staff had caused damage to some survivors\", and that concerns had been raised that some women were \"excluding themselves from approaching Rape Crisis Centres including ERCC\" because of their approach to gender identity. Ms Ling also said she had been made aware that some professionals had heard that \"some survivors did not feel safe using the centre\". After the report was published, Rape Crisis Scotland said it would pause referrals to ERCC - though people can still self-refer - until it was happy the review recommendations had been put in place. Ms Brindley said she knew nothing of issues at the centre until October last year. She said she then advised the ERCC board to settle the case rather than proceeding with the employment tribunal and acknowledged she should have been aware of the conflict sooner. Ms Brindley added there had been \"significant failures\" at the ERCC and she hoped to introduce a \"robust framework of assessment\" to make sure the national standards are followed and that women-only spaces are provided in future.\n",
            "\n",
            "Groups including For Women Scotland, which has campaigned against changes to transgender rights, have accused the ERCC board of \"ignoring its own culpability\". The BBC understands Ms Brindley has the full support of Rape Crisis Scotland's board to stay in post despite Conservative MSP Sue Webber calling for her to quit. Ms Brindley said the controversy had led to rape survivors who supported the charity experiencing \"horrendous\" abuse online, including being told that they \"must be lying\" about being raped. \"It is absolutely astonishing to me that this is the position we're in where rape survivors can be treated in this way in the name of women's rights supposedly,\" said Ms Brindley. \"I think the onus is on me as chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland and on the rape crisis movement to try and move to a place where Rape Crisis is not being weaponised in the way it has.\" She stressed that rape survivors could rely on the charity and that it would meet their needs. Ms Brindley also addressed the comments made by Ms Wadhwa in the podcast, saying: \"I do not think the word ‘bigot’ and ‘rape survivor’ should be used in the same sentence. \"When that podcast came out, Mridul assured us that her comments had been taken out of context - that she hadn’t intended them to refer to rape survivors that wanted a single-sex service.\"\n",

            "A team of scientists say it is “beyond reasonable doubt” the Covid pandemic started with infected animals sold at a market, rather than a laboratory leak. They were analysing hundreds of samples collected from Wuhan, China, in January 2020. The results identify a shortlist of animals – including racoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats – as potential sources of the pandemic. Despite even highlighting one market stall as a hotspot of both animals and coronavirus, the study cannot provide definitive proof.\n",

            "The samples were collected by Chinese officials in the early stages of Covid and are one of the most scientifically valuable sources of information on the origins of the pandemic. An early link with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was established when patients appeared in hospitals in Wuhan with a mystery pneumonia. The market was closed and teams swabbed locations including stalls, the inside of animal cages and equipment used to strip fur and feathers from slaughtered animals.\n",

            "Their analysis was published last year and the raw data made available to other scientists. Now a team in the US and France says they have performed even more advanced genetic analyses to peer deeper into Covid’s early days. It involved analysing millions of short fragments of genetic code – both DNA and RNA – to establish what animals and viruses were in the market in January 2020. \"We are seeing the DNA and RNA ghosts of these animals in the environmental samples, and some are in stalls where [the Covid virus] was found too,\" says Prof Florence Débarre, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. The results, published in the journal Cell, highlight a series of findings that come together to make their case. It shows Covid virus and susceptible animals were detected in the same location, with some individual swabs collecting both animal and coronavirus genetic code. This is not evenly distributed across the market and points to very specific hotspots. \"We find a very consistent story in terms of this pointing - even at the level of a single stall - to the market as being the very likely origin of this particular pandemic,\" says Prof Kristian Andersen, from the Scripps Institute in the US. However, being in the same place at the same time is not proof any animals were infected.\n",

            "The animal which came up most frequently in the samples was the common raccoon dog. This has been shown to both catch and transmit Covid in experiments. Other animals identified as a potential source of the pandemic were the masked palm civet, which was also associated with the Sars outbreak in 2003, as well as hoary bamboo rats and Malayan porcupines. The experiments have not been done to see if they can spread the virus. The depth of the genetic analysis was able to identify the specific types of raccoon dogs being sold. They were those more commonly found in the wild in South China rather than those farmed for their fur. This gives scientists clues about where to look next.\n",

            "The research teams also analysed the genetic code of the viral samples found in the market, and compared them to samples from patients in the early days of the pandemic. Looking at the variety of different mutations in the viral samples also provides clues. The samples suggest, but do not prove, that Covid started more than once in the market with potentially two spillover events from animals to humans. The researchers say this supports the idea of the market as the origin, rather than the pandemic starting elsewhere with the market adding fuel to the fire in a superspreading event. The scientists also used the mutations to build the virus’s family tree and peer into its past. “If we estimate when do we believe most likely the pandemic started versus when do we believe most likely the outbreak at the market started, these two overlap, they’re one and the same,” says Prof Andersen. In their scientific publication, the full genetic diversity of coronavirus seen in the early days of the pandemic was found at the market. Prof Michael Worobey, of the University of Arizona, said: \"Rather than being one small branch on this big bushy evolutionary tree, the market sequences are across all the branches of the tree, in a way that is consistent with the genetic diversity actually beginning at the market.\" He said this study, combined with other data – such as early cases and hospitalisations being linked to the market – all pointed to an animal origin of Covid. Prof Worobey said: “It's far beyond reasonable doubt that that this is how it happened”, and that other explanations for the data required \"really quite fanciful absurd scenarios\". “I think there's been a lack of appreciation even up until now about how strong the evidence is.”\n",

The Premier League club has made two seats available to Sir Keir, a season-ticket holder, in the corporate area of Emirates Stadium. In interviews with BBC regional political editors, he said he had been advised it would cost the taxpayer more in security costs to use his normal seat. He added that he would \"rather be in the stands\", but that accepting a corporate ticket was a \"perfectly sensible arrangement\".\n",

He has declared just over £12,000 worth of tickets and hospitality for Arsenal matches, from both the club itself, other clubs, the Premier League and commercial companies, since becoming Labour leader in 2020. Speaking to BBC London political editor Tim Donovan, Sir Keir said he had been following Arsenal from the stands for \"many, many years\", but \"a lot of policing\" would be required for him to continue doing this as prime minister. He added that he would not be giving up his season ticket, but confirmed Arsenal had \"made arrangements for me to watch from elsewhere\".\n",

In a separate interview with BBC Yorkshire political editor James Vincent, Sir Keir said it would cost the taxpayer \"a fortune\" in extra security for him to watch games from the stands. He added people would consider it \"pretty self-indulgent if I said I’m not going to move from the stands, even if it costs the taxpayer more money\". “Frankly, I’d rather be in the stands, but I’m not going to ask the taxpayer to indulge me to be in the stands, when I could go and sit somewhere else. “That’s for me, a common sense situation,\" he added.\n",

            "\n",
            "More than 30,000 Boeing workers are on strike after their union rejected a deal that would have raised pay in exchange for the loss of bonuses and pensions. The employees are now in their second week of striking with no sign of any deal with Boeing management on the horizon. We asked workers on the picket line outside a Boeing factory in Auburn, Washington, why they feel they have no choice but to strike.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many of the strikers the BBC spoke to cited the loss of their bonuses and pensions, as well as inflation and the cost of living, as their reasons for walking out. Davon Smith, 37, earns under $28 (£21) an hour attaching the wings to Boeing 777X planes, which sell for over $400m (£300m) each. He also works as a security guard at a bar to make ends meet. “That kind of keeps me afloat, a little bit,” he says about the part-time security job. His fiancée, who works as a secretary for Seattle schools, earns more than him. Smith, who has worked at Boeing for only a year, says his pay rate doesn’t compensate him for the level of safety that goes into ensuring that the planes don’t fail. He says he’s concerned he could be held criminally liable if his work isn’t done correctly. “Every time we make a plane to their spec, we pretty much put our life on the line. Because if anything goes wrong – like if it’s a torque’s out of spec or something like that – and potentially the plane goes down, we obviously get [jail] time for that,” he says.\n",
            "\n",
            "The deal that union representatives and Boeing had tentatively agreed would have seen workers get a 25% pay rise over four years. It also offered improved healthcare and retirement benefits, 12 weeks of paid parental leave, and would have given union members more say on safety and quality issues. However, the union had initially targeted a 40% pay rise, and almost 95% of union members who voted rejected the deal. Many remain angry about benefits lost during contract negotiations years ago - especially the pension, which guaranteed certain payouts in retirement. Now, the firm contributes to worker investment accounts known as 401(k)s, making their values subject to the strength of the stock market. “They just took everything away. They took away our pensions, they took away our bonuses that people rely on,” says Mari Baker, 61, who started at Boeing in 1996 and currently works as a kitter, overseeing the tools used at factories. She calls the rejected deal “a slap in the face”, but says she is worried about losing her health insurance at the end of the month, if the strike continues and whether she’ll be able to afford her prescription medication.\n",
            "\n",
            "Boeing declined to comment for this story, pointing to earlier comments by executives pledging to reset the relationship with workers and work towards a deal as soon as possible. Before the stoppage, the company was already facing deepening financial losses and struggling to repair its reputation after a series of safety issues. New chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who was appointed to turn the business around, had urged workers not to strike as it would put the company's \"recovery in jeopardy\". On Wednesday, the firm announced it was suspending the jobs of tens of thousands of staff in the US as a way of saving money in response to the strike. Patrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group, a research and consulting firm, says Boeing is a company \"on the precipice\". His firm estimates that the strike, just in its first week, has already cost workers at the firm and its suppliers more than $100m in lost wages and shareholders more than $440m, among other economic losses. \"This strike doesn't just threaten earnings, it threatens the reputation of the company at a time when that reputation has suffered hugely,\" he says. Workers on the picket line dismiss the threat to the firm, saying they have little to lose. “This past year working here I couldn’t afford to pay my mortgage,” says Kerri Foster, 47, who joined Boeing last year after leaving her previous career as a nurse and now works as an aerospace mechanic.\n",

            "Foster says that she has not been “making enough to pay basic bills”. Meanwhile, the cost of living is increasing, along with her mortgage payments and property taxes. She’s willing to keep striking until her pay is increased and pension restored, despite the loss of income while the strike continues. “I’m hungry already. I mean, if you can’t pay your bills when you’re going to work, what’s the difference?” she says. Ryan Roberson, 38, works in the final assembly division at Boeing. He brought two of his six children to the picket line with him on Wednesday. As an employee at Boeing for less than a year, the plan that the union rejected would not have had any impact on his wages. Increases would have only gone to those working for more than a year. He says he plans to keep striking until workers at “that entry level can have a liveable wage”.\n",

That $250 “will buy a lot of Top Ramen”, says Roberson, referring to the ultra-cheap instant noodles. Marc Cisneros, 29, says he is striking “because for the amount of work I do and the quality that I produce, it seems unfair that I’m unable to afford my rent”.\n",

Surgeon Elias Jaradeh said he treated women and children but most of the patients he saw were young men. The surgeon said a large proportion were “severely injured” and many had lost the sight in both eyes. The dead and injured in Lebanon include fighters from Hezbollah – the Iranian backed armed group which has been trading cross-border fire with Israel for months and is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US. But members of their families have also been killed or wounded, along with innocent bystanders. Elias Jaradeh described the wounded he treated as looking \"mostly civilian\".\n",

Warning: This report contains graphic details Dr Jaradeh, who is also an MP for the Change parliamentary bloc, was working at a specialist eye and ear hospital where some of the most severely wounded people were sent. He said it had taken a toll on the medical teams, himself included. \"And, yes, it's very hard,\" the surgeon said. \"You have to dissociate yourself. More or less, you are robotic. This is the way you have to behave, but inside, you are deeply injured. You are seeing the nation injured.\" Surgeons like Dr Jaradeh worked for almost 24 hours continuously on the wounded, many of whom have lost their eyesight or the use of their hands, the country's health minister told the BBC. Eye specialist Prof Elias Warrak told BBC Arabic that in one night he extracted more damaged eyes than he had previously in his entire career. \"It was very hard,\" he said. \"Most of the patients were young men in their twenties and in some cases I had to remove both eyes. In my whole life I had not seen scenes similar to what I saw yesterday.\" Health Minister Firass Abiad told the BBC the victims' injuries would prove life-changing. “This is something that unfortunately will require a lot of rehabilitation,” he said. About 3,200 people were injured, most of them in Tuesday's attack which saw thousands of pagers detonated.

They were in civilian areas with their families.” Witnesses described seeing people with severe wounds to their faces and hands after the attacks. Journalist Sally Abou al-Joud says she saw patients \"covered in blood\" at hospitals, where ambulances were arriving \"one after the other within the minute\". Most injuries she saw were \"in the faces and the eyes\". \"We’re talking about hands injured, severely injured fingers torn, I’ve heard some doctors say we need to perform amputation surgeries to remove hands... they need to perform surgeries for eyes to remove them,\" she said. One woman told BBC Arabic on Thursday that what they had seen was a \"massacre in every sense of the world\". \"Young men were walking in the street with injuries to their hands, waist and eyes... they were unable to see anything,\" she said. In the aftermath of Tuesday's blasts, writer and politician Tracy Chamoun said she saw one man with his eye blown out and another \"had half of his face ripped off\". She had been driving in southern Beirut - a Hezbollah stronghold - at the time.\n",

            "Many Lebanese in Beirut say the device attacks have reignited their trauma from the Beirut port explosion four years ago. At least 200 people were killed and 5,000 injured when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at a warehouse in the port blew up, sending a mushroom cloud into the air and a supersonic blastwave tearing through the city. \"We remembered such painful scenes... it is something truly terrifying,\" one woman told BBC Arabic. \"A state of confusion, discomfort and anxiety is dominating all Lebanon... what happened to us four years ago is being repeated now.” In the aftermath of the exploding pagers and radio devices the Lebanese army has been destroying suspicious devices with controlled detonations, while walkie-talkies and pagers have now been banned onboard all flights operating at Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport - the only operational commercial airport in Lebanon. More than 90 of those injured are now in Iran receiving further treatment, according to Tehran's embassy in Lebanon. That includes Iran's ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, whose condition has been described as \"very good\" by the embassy in its statement. Officials didn't elaborate on how serious the injuries suffered by the other transferees were. Abiad said the \"weaponisation of technology” was something very serious, he said, not only for Lebanon but also for the rest of the world, and for other conflicts. “Now we have to think twice before using technology,” he said.\n",

            "At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured, many seriously, after communication devices, some used by the armed group Hezbollah, dramatically exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the latest round of blasts on Wednesday, exploding walkie-talkies killed 20 and injured at least 450 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. The explosions occurred in the vicinity of a large crowd that had gathered for the funerals of four victims of Tuesday's simultaneous pager blasts, which killed at least 12 people and injured nearly 3,000. BBC teams in the city reported chaotic scenes in which ambulances struggled to reach the injured, and locals became suspicious of anyone using a phone. The explosions deepened unease in Lebanese society, coming a day after the apparently similar, and highly sophisticated attack targeting thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members. The militant group blamed its adversary Israel. Israeli officials have so far declined to comment. Two firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility. A Japanese company which apparently makes the walkie-talkies said it stopped producing that model 10 years ago. Here is what we know so far.\n",
            "\n",
            "How did the attacks unfold?\n",
            "\n",
            "The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time (13:30 BST) on Tuesday. Witnesses reported seeing smoke coming from people's pockets, before seeing small explosions that sounded like fireworks and gunshots. Citing US officials, the New York Times said that the pagers received messages that appeared to be coming from Hezbollah's leadership before detonating. The messages instead appeared to trigger the devices, the outlet reported. Explosions continued for around an hour after the initial blasts, the Reuters news agency reported. Soon after, scores of people began arriving at hospitals across Lebanon, with witnesses reporting mass confusion in emergency departments. Similar scenes played out across the country in another round of blasts on Wednesday, at around 17:00 local time (15:00 BST). Reports suggest it was walkie-talkies that were blown up, devices that were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, according to a security source speaking to Reuters news agency. At least one explosion was close to a funeral being held in Beirut for some of the victims of Tuesday's attack, creating panic among those near the procession. Twenty people have been killed and at least 450 injured, according to Lebanon's health ministry.\n",
            "\n",
            "What do we know about the devices?\n",
            "\n",
            "Details about the walkie-talkies detonated in Wednesday's explosions are still coming to light. Footage shot in the aftermath showed destroyed devices bearing the brand Icom, a Japanese company. A statement from the firm describes the IC-V82 model as a handheld radio which was exported to the Middle East from 2004 to 2014 and has not been shipped since then. Icom said production on that model stopped 10 years ago. The manufacturing of the batteries has also stopped, it says. The company says it is not possible to confirm whether the IC-V82s that exploded in yesterday's attacks were shipped directly from Icom, or via a distributor. It said any products for overseas markets were sold only to the firm’s authorised distributors. But the models may not even be from Icom. Earlier, a sales executive at the US subsidiary of Icom told AP news agency that the devices which exploded in Lebanon appeared to be a knock-off product – adding it was easy to find counterfeit versions of the product online. The pagers that exploded on Tuesday were a new brand that the group had not used before, one Hezbollah operative told AP. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that around 5,000 pagers were brought into the country about five months ago.\n",
            "\n",
            "Labels seen on fragments of exploded pagers point to a pager model called the Rugged Pager AR-924. But its Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo has denied any involvement with the explosions. When the BBC visited Gold Apollo on Wednesday local police were searching the company's offices, inspecting documents and questioning staff. Taiwan pager maker stunned by link to Lebanon attacks The founder, Hsu Ching-Kuang, said his company had signed an agreement with a Hungarian-based company - BAC - to manufacture the devices and use his company's name. He added that money transfers from them had been \"very strange\", without elaborating. BBC Verify has accessed BAC’s company records, which reveal it was first incorporated in 2022. Its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono told NBC that she knew nothing about the explosions. “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong,\" she said. The Hungarian government said the company had \"no manufacturing or operational site\" in the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "What prompted the pager attack?\n",
            "\n",
            "Unnamed US and Israeli officials told Axios that detonating the pagers all at once was initially planned as the opening move in an \"all-out\" offensive against Hezbollah. But in recent days Israel became concerned Hezbollah had become aware of the plan - so they were set off early. Israeli officials have not commented on the allegations, but most analysts agree that it seems likely it is behind the attack. Prof Simon Mabon, chair in International Relations at Lancaster University, told the BBC: \"We know that Israel has a precedent of using technology to track its target\" - but he called the scale of this attack \"unprecedented\". Lina Khatib, from the UK-based Chatham House, said the attack suggested that Israel has \"deeply\" infiltrated Hezbollah's \"communications network\". In its statement accusing Israel of being behind the attacks, Hezbollah said it held the country \"fully responsible for this criminal aggression that also targeted civilians\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Why does Hezbollah use pagers?\n",
            "\n",
            "Hezbollah has relied heavily on pagers as a low-tech means of communications to try to evade location-tracking by Israel. Pagers are wireless telecommunications devices that receive and display alphanumeric or voice messages. They are much harder to track than mobile phones, which have long since been abandoned as simply too vulnerable, as Israel’s assassination of the Hamas bomb-maker Yahya Ayyash demonstrated as long ago as 1996, when his phone exploded in his hand. In February, Hassan Nasrallah directed Hezbollah fighters to get rid of their phones, saying they had been infiltrated by Israeli intelligence. He told his forces to break, bury or lock their phones in an iron box. Experts now say the directive, issued during a live televised address, may have forewarned Israeli intelligence operatives that the group would be seeking a new - likely lower tech - method of communications.\n",

            "A source close to Hezbollah told AFP news agency that two of those killed in Tuesday's attack were the sons of two Hezbollah MPs. They also said the daughter of a Hezbollah member was killed. Among the injured was Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani. Reports in Iranian media said his injuries were minor. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was not hurt in the explosions, Reuters reported quoting a source. Lebanese Public Health Minister Firass Abiad said damage to the hands and face made up the majority of injuries. The victims presenting to emergency rooms were a variety of ages, from the old to the very young, some wearing civilian clothes, he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Outside of Lebanon, 14 people were injured in similar blasts in neighbouring Syria, according to UK-based campaign group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n",

            "Hezbollah is allied with Israel's arch-nemesis in the region, Iran. The group is part of Tehran's Axis of Resistance and has been engaged in a low-level war with Israel for months, frequently exchanging rocket and missile fire across Israel's northern border. Entire communities have been displaced from both sides. The blasts came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. While visiting an Israeli airbase on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the country was \"opening a new phase in the war\" and and the \"centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces\". Despite the ongoing tensions, observers say that until now both sides have aimed to contain hostilities without crossing the line into full-scale war. But there are fears that the situation could spiral out of control.\n",

            "Some prisoners released early as part of efforts to ease overcrowding have not been fitted with electronic tracking devices, despite it being a condition of their release, the BBC has been told. Several offenders released on licence said they had not been fitted with an ankle tag - with one describing it as \"a disaster waiting to happen\". One probation officer said the delays in them being fitted appeared to be due to a shortage of tags, while the Ministry of Justice said it was due to a backlog of former prisoners. The MoJ blamed security contractor Serco - which manages the prison tagging system - for the delays. Serco said it was working to reduce the numbers waiting for tags.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prisons minister Lord James Timpson said the delays to tagging were \"completely unacceptable\" and called what he described as an \"urgent meeting with Serco leaders\" on Thursday evening. He said they \"accepted the need for immediate action and personally committed to me to eliminate the backlog\" - which, Lord Timpson added, he expected would \"be done at pace over the coming weeks\". \"All offenders continue to be closely monitored by the Probation Service with stringent conditions and we are prioritising the tagging of domestic abusers on licence to ensure the safety of victims.\" More than 1,700 prisoners were let out early in England and Wales last week as part of the government's scheme to address overcrowding in prisons. The justice secretary said this had prevented the prison system from reaching maximum capacity and \"a total breakdown of law and order\". But the scheme has been criticised as risking public safety, while not all victims were made aware of their offender's early release date. Offenders jailed for violent offences with sentences of at least four years, sex offenders and domestic abusers were not eligible for early release, the government has said. Many of those let out last week were released on licence. In some cases, that means having to wear an ankle tag so that their movements can be monitored to check they are obeying a curfew or following other restrictions. Those who are not tagged are able to act without being monitored - increasing the risk of reoffending and danger to the public. One offender released last week told the BBC: \"They should have tagged me but they haven’t and it means I can go where I choose. \"I don’t want to end up back inside so I’m sticking to the curfew, but I know people who aren't doing that because they’ve not been tagged. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.\" In his case, he has been told to stay at home from 19:00 to 07:00.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another offender released last week said: \"I have to stay indoors till I get fitted, which means I can’t leave and it’s doing my head in - but I don’t want to get recalled into jail, so I’d rather do that but it would be easier if I was tagged. It’s a disgrace.\" Three probation officers spoke to BBC News on condition of anonymity. One, who said they believed the issue was down to a shortage of tags, said: \"We’re hearing the same story from several staff saying that people haven’t been tagged yet and it’s going to cause problems. \"Seems like people were released without the conditions on which they were released on being properly ready, and that could potentially be dangerous.\" Tagging or Home Detention Curfew (HDC) is a scheme which allows some people to be released early from custody if they have a suitable address to go to. If someone is released on HDC, they have rules to follow about where they can go and what time they have to be back at home. It allows the authorities to monitor the movements of an offender to dissuade them from reoffending. According to Martin Jones, the chief inspector of probation, about a third of those released early last week are expected to reoffend. The tagging system is operated by Electronic Monitoring Services (EMS), an organisation which is managed by Serco under a contract with the MoJ.\n",

Grinning, self-satisfied, the apple of his mother’s eye, a slightly ridiculous royal Romeo, this was the actor’s starting point for depicting the prince in his interview with BBC Two's Newsnight programme - and imagining the huge scale of his fall from grace. Sheen’s remarkable performance dominates this compelling three-part Amazon film, A Very Royal Scandal, as he captures a prince angry and disbelieving at his collapsing status. “I’m the son of the sovereign - if I want to go on telly and defend myself, I will,” he bellows, but with the addition of multiple strong swear words, in a way few royals have been portrayed before.\n",

He is a sweary, pompous and then needy figure, unaware of how much he is being exposed by his TV interrogator, Emily Maitlis, played by Ruth Wilson. The interview itself is often described as a “car crash” - but in this version, the prince's reputation is more like roadkill.\n",

Rufus Sewell said his interpretation of the prince owed something to David Brent, the deluded manager from BBC Two's The Office sitcom. In this Amazon Prime Video version, Sheen's Prince Andrew is a more complex figure, self-seeking, emotionally deaf, ambitious, loyal to his own immediate family, distrustful of palace officials and with a desperate need for approval. It is a performance where Richard III meets Alan Partridge. When he hears sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has died in prison, the prince's reaction is to ask: “Is this good for me or bad?” And there’s a relentless tension between him and his brother, the then Prince of Wales. “Calls me a mummy’s boy, he’s the mummy’s boy,” Prince Andrew screams, with plenty of very strong swearing added, after an angry phone call.\n",

Prince Andrew is portrayed as casually rude to servants - and palace officials mull over the royals’ lack of empathy: “They’ve never been late for a train - because the train waits for them.” Although the recreated Newsnight interview is the centrepiece of the film, perhaps the most pivotal moment is a scene in the first episode, where the prince meets Epstein in New York. It is another excruciating interview, with an embarrassed Prince Andrew needing money and a tough, exploitative Epstein, played by John Hopkins, making him wriggle on his financial hook. Sheen shows the prince as out of his depth in front of such malevolence. And this terrible association with Epstein plays out through the film, with Prince Andrew protesting his innocence as the questions and accusations encircle him, until he is hiding from lawyers trying to serve court papers.\n",

The phone designers also know this. The tech spec of every new handset camera is usually an improvement on the previous generation. But even this isn’t a guaranteed sales generator any more. “What is definitely happening is that people are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2013 there were 30 million phones sold annually,” adds Mr Wood. “This year it will be around 13.5 million.” There is of course an ongoing cost of living crisis affecting people’s spending decisions.

Pupils starting at the public school Eton this term were issued feature phones (sometimes, rather unpopularly known as dumb phones), and I have heard of several other institutions, both in the private and state sectors, which are considering following suit. The mobile phone network EE recommends that children below the age of 11 shouldn’t have smartphones at all. Nova East leads the north and west London branch of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, which urges parents and schools to collaborate to delay the age at which children are given the devices. “We are not anti-tech, we are just pro-childhood,” she says. “We would like to see tech companies develop a child friendly phone, offering only essential features such as calls, messaging, music, and maps, without any additional functionalities.”\n",

I put this to Apple, Google and Samsung. The latter said: \"Samsung users can choose how they use their Galaxy phones that best fits their needs. For example, digital wellbeing features allow users to select what features they use, when they use them and for how long, such as setting a screen time limit on specific apps they want to restrict.\" One company that is listening to the growing calls for reduced phone functionality is the Finnish firm HMD – which still makes basic Nokia handsets. Last month it launched a Barbie-themed phone in collaboration with toymaker Mattel, and I tried it out. The two words I would use to describe it are: functional. And pink. Like most feature phones, it has no apps, no app store, no selfie camera, and only one game. If you want to listen to music there’s an FM radio. CCS Insight forecasts that around 400,000 feature phones are likely to be sold in the UK this year – nowhere near enough to knock the iPhone off the top of the list of the world’s most-sold handsets any time soon, but not a bad market space. I just checked my own screentime over the past seven days, and I averaged around five hours per day, This is admittedly a sobering statistic – but it wasn’t all doomscrolling (honest).

Schools across Emilia Romagna have closed. Some roads were impacted by landslides and railway traffic has been severely disrupted. Authorities warned residents to stay out of their basements and to relocate to the upper floors of their homes. Schools, libraries and parks were shut in Ravenna, and the University of Bologna cancelled exams and lessons. The city of Faenza has been the worst-affected, with the levels of the two rivers crossing it rising rapidly overnight.

The rain will ease through Friday, and the weekend is looking largely dry but as seen in other parts of central Europe, the flooding risk may continue. For residents of Emilia-Romagna, Storm Boris echoes the severe – and deadly - flooding the region faced just over a year ago. In May 2023, 13 people died after six months' rainfall fell in a day and a half, leading to more than 20 rivers bursting their banks. Tens of thousands of people had to flee their homes and the flooding caused billions of euros of damage. Although the worst of Storm Boris appears to be over across much of the region, the levels of the Danube River are still rising in Hungary. Prime Minister Victor Orban said on Wednesday the water level in Budapest was expected to peak on Saturday afternoon or evening, but that it would be lower than record levels seen in 2013.\n",

            "The decision to hold interest rates, which was widely expected, follows a cut from 5.25% in August - the first reduction since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. \"I think interest rates are going to come down, I'm optimistic on that front,\" Mr Bailey said. But he said it was \"vital\" that inflation remains low. \"So we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much,” he added. The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and other lenders. The higher level has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns. Higher interest rates push mortgage rates up. This can result in landlords raising their rent to cover higher repayments.\n",

They moved to a smaller terraced house where they are paying £1,400. They have a joint income of £54,000 and say they cannot save for a deposit to buy a house. \"When I went on maternity leave, I could only go off for about 10 weeks because we just couldn't afford any more. Even that was a major stretch to the point where we had to put ourselves into a bit of debt,\" Sofia said. She added food banks helped them and sometimes her husband had to work from home as he did not have the money to put fuel in the car. The Bank said the decision to hold this month was \"guided by the need to squeeze persistent inflationary pressures\" out of the UK economy. It expects inflation to rise to around 2.5% towards the end of this year, but it also suggested the country’s economic picture was improving.\n",

It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company,” Icom said in a statement. “The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company.” Icom further added that all its radios are manufactured at the same factory in Japan, and that it only sells products for overseas markets via authorised distributors.\n",

Tony Soper co-founded the BBC's Natural History Unit, which began in Bristol in 1957 and has since produced countless wildlife programmes around the world. Mr Soper was born in Southampton in 1929 and brought up in Plymouth, where he started his career at the corporation as a trainee engineer in 1947.

According to his website, he started working as a freelancer in 1963 so he could live closer to the sea in Devon. He subsequently pursued a career leading wildlife cruises to the Arctic and Antarctica, writing a multitude of books about wildlife in the UK and further afield. Mr Soper is survived by his wife Hilary, his two sons Tim and Jack and his five grandchildren.\n",

The father-of-two did not enter a plea to the charge at Carlisle Magistrates court but his lawyer said he \"strenuously\" denied involvement in any plan to import drugs to the UK.

Prosecutor Diane Jackson told the court that two women aged 28 and 32, had been arrested following the discovery of the drugs. She said that they were travelling business class into the UK from Bangkok via Dubai. The court heard that one of the women is the partner of Emmanuel-Thomas.

After being questioned by the NCA, both women were charged with drug importation offences. They appeared before Chelmsford Magistrates Court and were bailed to appear at Chelmsford Crown Court on 1 October.

Ch Supt Daniel Greenwood, a district commander in Bradford who had been in charge of West Yorkshire Police's response to the pandemic, previously admitted gross misconduct but denied an \"absolute breach\" of lockdown rules. A misconduct panel said the officer had \"abused his position of trust\" by conducting the consensual affair with his younger and lower ranking colleague. The conclusion of a tribunal found 41-year-old Mr Greenwood would have been dismissed without notice had he not already resigned.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr Greenwood admitted having sex with the woman twice during the extramarital encounters, with the senior officer helping with her application to join the police two years prior to their relationship. Evidence submitted to the panel described how Mr Greenwood attended a flat in early 2021 and had sex with her, with the visit \"in breach\" of new Covid restrictions introduced on 6 January. Mr Greenwood, through his representative, disputed the date of the encounter, claiming it had taken place before that set of rules had been introduced. He also denied it was an \"absolute breach\" of Covid rules, but accepted it was \"obviously contrary to the spirit\" of them. The West Yorkshire Police Authority panel concluded, however, that the woman had been \"consistent\" with her evidence that Mr Greenwood had made the visit after 6 January.

Concluding the findings of fact against the officer, panel chair Craig Hassall KC said there had been \"widespread public revulsion towards breaches of Covid regulations, especially from those in positions of responsibility.\" He said that the woman was \"vulnerable\" for reasons including the age gap and her rank, therefore his actions were \"an abuse of his position for a sexual purpose\". Had Mr Greenwood not resigned ahead of the hearing, he would have been dismissed to \"maintain public confidence in West Yorkshire Police and policing generally\", Mr Hassall concluded. Speaking after the hearing, deputy chief constable Catherine Hankinson said Mr Greenwood had \"behaved in a manner which brings discredit on the police service\" and \"undermines public trust\". She added: \"The public deserves police officers who hold the highest standards, and his actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of honest and hardworking police officers and staff in West Yorkshire. \"I hope people feel reassured that all allegations of discreditable conduct will be robustly investigated, and such behaviour has no place in our service.\" Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.\n",

            "A charity chief executive has apologised \"unreservedly\" to rape survivors affected by failings at support centre in Edinburgh. Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) came under fire when a review found it had failed to provide women-only spaces for 16 months, and that its CEO - trans woman Mridul Wadhwa - had not acted professionally or understood the limits of her authority. Sandy Brindley, of Rape Crisis Scotland, said she found out the centre was not following national standards last October and paused referrals 11 months later when the review said safeguarding was a problem. She told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme there was no reason why transgender people could not work in rape support centres, but that services must also provide women-only spaces.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Brindley stressed that Rape Crisis Scotland, which is the national charity that sets service standards for member centres, had no involvement in hiring Ms Wadhwa - who stood down from her role after the review was published last week. However she said there had been \"no reason\" not to agree with the appointment at the time as Ms Wadhwa had significant experience of working in the sector. The role Ms Wadhwa had is reserved for women only – which under recent guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission includes trans women who have a gender recognition certificate. Ms Wadhwa took over the ERCC in 2021 - before this guidance was updated. Acknowledging that Ms Wadhwa's appointment had been controversial, Ms Brindley said: \"I was not involved in that appointment or that decision. But what I would say is that most rape crisis centres in Scotland provide support to men, women, trans people and non-binary people. \"There is no inherent reason within that, that you could not have a trans person working within a rape crisis centre. \"I think what is crucial however, is that if you do have a rape crisis service, that is supporting all survivors is that there's dedicated women-only spaces within that.\" Ms Brindley added she \"absolutely recognised\" that women-only spaces were a priority for many women using rape support services.\n",

            "Ms Wadhwa was living as a woman in her native India before arriving in the UK in 2002. Her passport said she was female. She has been working in the the violence against women and equality sectors in Scotland since 2005. She has previously tried to stand for election for the SNP but was not selected as a candidate and later joined the Scottish Greens. In a 2020 interview with The Ferret news service, she said that coverage of claims she was “legally male” had unleashed “a host of hate” and that the focus on having a gender recognition certificate was racist as well as transphobic because it failed to take in Indian cultural norms. The following year she was interviewed on the Guilty Feminist podcast, and was asked about rape survivors who might be uncomfortable with the presence of trans women in spaces such as rape crisis centres. In her response, she said that “sexual violence can happen to bigoted people too” and that if rape victims hold “unacceptable beliefs that are discriminatory in nature we will begin to work with you on your journey of recovery from trauma”.\n",

            "'Damage to some survivors'\n",
            "\n",
            "Controversy arose around the Edinburgh centre when an employment tribunal found in May of this year that a counsellor - Roz Adams - had been unfairly constructively dismissed over her belief that people who used the service should be able to know the sex of the staff that would be dealing with their case. Ms Wadhwa was highlighted in the tribunal outcome as she appeared to believe that Ms Adams was transphobic. Rape Crisis Scotland then commissioned legal consultant Vicky Ling to review the Edinburgh service. Ms Ling found that the centre had failed to protect women-only spaces for 16 months and that Ms Wadhwa \"did not understand the limits on her role’s authority, when to refer decisions to trustees and failed to set professional standards of behaviour\". The report also said there was \"evidence that the actions of some ERCC staff had caused damage to some survivors\", and that concerns had been raised that some women were \"excluding themselves from approaching Rape Crisis Centres including ERCC\" because of their approach to gender identity. Ms Ling also said she had been made aware that some professionals had heard that \"some survivors did not feel safe using the centre\". After the report was published, Rape Crisis Scotland said it would pause referrals to ERCC - though people can still self-refer - until it was happy the review recommendations had been put in place. Ms Brindley said she knew nothing of issues at the centre until October last year. She said she then advised the ERCC board to settle the case rather than proceeding with the employment tribunal and acknowledged she should have been aware of the conflict sooner. Ms Brindley added there had been \"significant failures\" at the ERCC and she hoped to introduce a \"robust framework of assessment\" to make sure the national standards are followed and that women-only spaces are provided in future.\n",
            "\n",
            "Groups including For Women Scotland, which has campaigned against changes to transgender rights, have accused the ERCC board of \"ignoring its own culpability\". The BBC understands Ms Brindley has the full support of Rape Crisis Scotland's board to stay in post despite Conservative MSP Sue Webber calling for her to quit. Ms Brindley said the controversy had led to rape survivors who supported the charity experiencing \"horrendous\" abuse online, including being told that they \"must be lying\" about being raped. \"It is absolutely astonishing to me that this is the position we're in where rape survivors can be treated in this way in the name of women's rights supposedly,\" said Ms Brindley. \"I think the onus is on me as chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland and on the rape crisis movement to try and move to a place where Rape Crisis is not being weaponised in the way it has.\" She stressed that rape survivors could rely on the charity and that it would meet their needs. Ms Brindley also addressed the comments made by Ms Wadhwa in the podcast, saying: \"I do not think the word ‘bigot’ and ‘rape survivor’ should be used in the same sentence. \"When that podcast came out, Mridul assured us that her comments had been taken out of context - that she hadn’t intended them to refer to rape survivors that wanted a single-sex service.\"\n",

            "The NHS in Wales “desperately” needs reform, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said. Asked if Welsh Labour had run the health service well, he said “there are challenges… I’m not going to pretend to you otherwise”. His comments came on the day that waiting lists hit a record high in Wales for the sixth month in a row. Sir Keir has described the NHS in England as “broken”, but refused to say the same about Wales, despite some waiting times being worse.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Welsh Conservatives said Sir Keir's comments were not credible while Plaid Cymru said they were \"deeply embarrassing\" for Labour.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cutting waiting times has been named as a top priority by new First Minister Eluned Morgan. Earlier this week she said reform was necessary, “but it’s difficult to do that when you've got long waiting lists that have to be our priority at the moment”. In a BBC Wales interview ahead of the Labour conference, the prime minister said he and Morgan had discussed the state of the health service. \"I think what we need to do is to roll up our sleeves, collaborate, share best practice and bring about not just the investment but the reform that is desperately needed across the delivery of health, whether that’s in Wales or elsewhere,” he said. Wales’ health service has been overseen by Labour-led governments since devolution in 1999. Sir Keir was asked if his party’s Welsh government had done a good job with the NHS during a quarter century in power. But he simply said: “There are challenges that need to be met, there’s no doubt about that and I’m not going to pretend to you otherwise. “My job with the first minister is to work together to rise to whatever challenges there are and opportunities across Wales and I’m determined to do so.”\n",

            "Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"Waiting lists in the Welsh NHS, run by Labour for the past 25 years, are far longer than in England. \"Given that Sir Keir has repeatedly claimed the English NHS is 'broken', this stance is simply not credible.\" Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"This is deeply embarrassing for Labour in Wales.\" He added: \"The NHS in Wales needs reform, and tinkering at the edges won’t fix it. We need to invest properly in the preventative agenda to keep people out of hospital, tackle the deep-rooted issues of staff retention, harness technological innovations to bring care closer to home, and modernise the NHS estate.\"\n",
